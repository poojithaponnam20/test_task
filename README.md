# Anomaly Detection
## Purpose:
This project sets up an anomaly detection problem. The goal is to distinguish between "normal" and "problematic" data, where the "problematic" data has been altered in some way (shifted or flipped). The task demonstrates how anomaly detection models can be trained and evaluated.

## Technologies Used
matplotlib: For plotting and visualizing data.

numpy: For numerical operations and data manipulation.

sklearn: For machine learning models and preprocessing.

iav_flap_anomaly_detection: A custom module included in the .py file format that handles data generation.
